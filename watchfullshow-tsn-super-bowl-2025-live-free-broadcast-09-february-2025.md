It's been quite a month for Kendrick Lamar. The rapper is fresh off of five new Grammy Awards last weekend thanks to his bombshell diss track "Not Like Us." Among the accolades were Song of the Year and Record of the Year. Now, he'll take center stage at Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans with the help of some friends, like SZA.

The Super Bowl halftime show is a time-honored tradition and has become almost as much of a spectacle as the football game itself. Usher, Rihanna, The Weeknd, Shakira, and Jennifer Lopez are just some of the stars to grace the stage over the past few years. Some of the most memorable performances have come from Prince, U2, Beyoncé, Madonna, and Lady Gaga. Lamar notably performed at Super Bowl LVI with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Mary J. Blige.

Below, we've put together everything you need to know about tuning in for Kendrick Lamar (and the rest of the Super Bowl, too, if that's your thing). We'll show you how to watch for free and how to use a VPN if you're overseas. While the Super Bowl kicks off at 6:30 p.m. ET, we'll give a rough estimate of what time the halftime show might begin.

How to watch the Kendrick Lamar Super Bowl halftime show in the US

You've probably heard by now, but the Super Bowl will live stream on Tubi this year for free. This just requires free account creation to access, and then you're all set to start watching the broadcast — including the halftime show.

If you're curious about exploring the FOX broadcast through a live TV streaming service that carries other channels, Sling TV, DirecTV Stream, and Fubo are three of the best. These great options carry tons of sports-friendly channels, so you'll be all set to watch your favorite teams beyond the Super Bowl.

DirecTV Stream, which we've dubbed the best cable alternative when it comes to live TV streaming services, has pretty much everything you need when it comes to watch the full NFL season, in addition to NBA, WNBA, PGA, MLB, and other major nationally broadcast leagues. The service's base Entertainment tier costs $87/month and comes with 90+ key channels, but you can also give the new MySports package a go. This carries at least 25 major sports networks (including FOX) for $70/month. Right now, you can try it out free for five days and get your first three months for $50/month.
